Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add potatoes, turnips and carrots. Combine 1/2 teaspoon salt, chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, cinnamon and cumin; sprinkle over vegetables. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are tender, 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place salmon, skin side down, in a foil-lined 15x10x1-in. baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining salt and pepper. Bake 10 minutes. Preheat broiler; broil until fish just begins to flake easily, 2-5 minutes. Serve salmon with vegetables.
